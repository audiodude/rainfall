# Rainfall
Free alternative to Bandcamp, letting you publish music sites to Netlify using Faircamp.

This project does not aim to replicate the full feature set of the Bandcamp site/app. Instead, the goal is to allow artists to create individual websites where users can listen to and potentially download and pay for their tracks. These websites are created using the [Faircamp](https://codeberg.org/simonrepp/faircamp) static site generator, and can be hosted anywhere on the web.

Rainfall is in a very early stage of development! When finished, it will not only let you upload your tracks and metadata and preview the output website, it will also integrate with Netlify so that you can immediately upload your new website and host it for free under an account that you control.
